Nestor gets four new powers this week and we‚Äôre excited to get them in the hands of our users.

*   [**Meetup**](https://www.asknestor.me/powers/meetup): With this power, you can search for meetups in any country based on topics that interest you. Simply add topics that you want Nestor to search for and say _\`@nestorbot: meetup events\`_ to find all the great events near you. The developers here would be interested to know that the Meetup power uses the brand new [Brain API](https://github.com/nestor-powers/meetup).
*   [**Campaign Monitor**](https://www.asknestor.me/powers/campaignmonitor)**:** Control your Campaign Monitor account by adding or removing subscribers, and finding out how your most recent campaign did.
*   [**Travis CI**](https://www.asknestor.me/powers/travisci)**:** With the TravisCI power you can find out the status of your last continuous integration build, and restart or cancel them.
*   [**Currency Converter:**](https://www.asknestor.me/powers/currency) With this nifty little power you can convert from one currency to another and find out what the exchange rate is for a given currency.

There are more powers coming to Nestor‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif you would like one to be added, please give us a shout at [hello@asknestor.me](mailto:hello@asknestor.me).
