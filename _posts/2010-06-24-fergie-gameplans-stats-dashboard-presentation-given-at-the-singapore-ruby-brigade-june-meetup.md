I gave a quick presentation yesterday at the June installment of the [Singapore Ruby Brigade](http://groups.google.com/group/singapore-rb) held at [HackerspaceSG](http://hackerspace.sg/). As always, SRB is a great place to meet people and catch up with all the great work that's going on here. Many thanks to [Jason](http://twitter.com/jasonong) for organising the monthly meetups and to Zhenyi for his camerawork yesterday which has brought SRB June online.

It was also great to listen to [Ming Yeow](http://twitter.com/mingyeow) and his experiences (both the highs and the lows) while building [MrTweet](http://mrtweet.com/) as well as experiencing every layer of the 'startup stack' (as he put it) such as product management, fund raising, hiring and networking. For a person who's been three months into a startup, his talk definitely gave some good pointers as well as validation for the processes [we've](http://gameplanapp.com) already implemented.

My slides from yesterday are [at Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/gameplanapp/gameplans-panicinspired-stats-dashboard-called-fergie).
