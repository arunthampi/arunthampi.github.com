## Hacker News vs Product Hunt &mdash; A Launch Story

On July 15th 2015, [Nestor](https://asknestor.me) was launched to the public on Hacker News and Product Hunt. The launch was a success with hundreds and hundreds of teams signing up to use Nestor serving tens of thousands of users. This post analyzes the launch strategy as well as the **_million dollar question_** — where should you launch: Hacker News or Product Hunt?

But before that, what the heck is Nestor?

#### Your Team’s Intelligent Assistant

Nestor is a bot platform that is your team’s intelligent assistant on [Slack](https://slack.com). So whether it be **_managing your calendar_**

or **_calling Ubers_**,

or searching for **_restaurants_**

or finding out what **_how much money your business makes_** or how many sign ups your website gets; Nestor has you covered.

What started off as a weekend hack was starting to get a lot of interest from a close set of friends and I decided it was to open Nestor’s doors to a larger audience.

#### Launch Day

I decided to launch on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com). This was a risk; as launching on social news sites is 50–50 (although my previous startup had a pretty successful launch on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4137820) three years ago)

Once again, the HN and PH audiences didn’t disappoint and Nestor was on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9892515) and [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/tech/nestor) on two consecutive days.

Thanks to everyone who upvoted for Nestor on Hacker News and Product Hunt! ❤

#### The Aftermath

Now for the big question: which channel performed better?

I’d integrated Mixpanel to Nestor pretty religiously on Day 1 of starting this project (as an aside, you can read about how to get [Mixpanel right the first time](https://medium.com/@iamclovin/ten-ways-to-get-mixpanel-right-the-first-time-717c87ca041)), so it was fairly simple to analyze.

The results were a little surprising to me but here goes:

> **Hacker News drove almost 2x traffic**

What was super interesting was that:

> **Product Hunt had almost 3.5x better Sign Up Conversion**

What this means is that even though **Hacker News drove double the raw traffic**, eventually **Product Hunt drove** **more users**. It’d be interesting to figure out why that is.

#### Why did Product Hunt outperform Hacker News?

I have a few theories:

1.  The HN audience is generally more skeptical of new products that resemble toys or tools they can build themselves in a few hours (case in point: [Dropbox’s launch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863) all those years ago)
2.  ProductHunt has better ways to showcase your product (by that I mean the ability to add images and cover photos). As an aside, it’d be fascinating to see how many “views” a product on PH gets so we can calculate Product Hunt -> Landing Page conversions.

This launch demonstrated to me that although Hacker News drives more traffic than Product Hunt, the latter leads to more activations. In a couple of months, I’d like to post my findings on which channel provided more engaged/retained users.

In the mean time, if you’d like to have an intelligent assistant help you out in your Slack team, add [Nestor to your Team](https://asknestor.me/join/medium).
