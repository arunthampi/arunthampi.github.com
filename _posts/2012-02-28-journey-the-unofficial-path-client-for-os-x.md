28 Feb 2012 - Singapore

It's taken us a while, but we're happy to announce that the little side project we've been working on &ndash; an [unofficial Path Client for OS X](http://journeyformac.com) is live. What's more it is open-source and is available under an MIT License on [GitHub](http://github.com/JourneyForMac/Journey). You can read a more in-depth behind-the-scenes story [here](http://dev.anideo.com/2012/02/26/introducing-journey-the-unofficial-path-client-for-os-x.html).

It's been a challenge working on [Denso](http://getdenso.com) as well as this side project, but I had a lot of fun working with [Peter](http://twitter.com/raingrove), [Kent](http://twitter.com/ntluan) and [AJ](http://twitter.com/ajhit406) on this Journey ;) (no pun intended).

We think the [Anideo](http://anideo.com) Hackathon experiment has been a success and we hope to continue to host more hackathons and foster a culture of building good software here in Singapore.
