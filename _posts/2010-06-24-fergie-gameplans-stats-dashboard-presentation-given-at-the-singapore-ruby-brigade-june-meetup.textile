p(meta). 24 Jun 2010 - Singapore

I gave a quick presentation yesterday at the June installment of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/singapore-rb">Singapore Ruby Brigade</a> held at <a href="http://hackerspace.sg/">HackerspaceSG</a>. As always, SRB is a great place to meet people and catch up with all the great work that's going on here. Many thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonong">Jason</a> for organising the monthly meetups and to Zhenyi for his camerawork yesterday which has brought SRB June online.

It was also great to listen to <a href="http://twitter.com/mingyeow">Ming Yeow</a> and his experiences (both the highs and the lows) while building <a href="http://mrtweet.com/">MrTweet</a> as well as experiencing every layer of the 'startup stack' (as he put it) such as product management, fund raising, hiring and networking. For a person who's been three months into a startup, his talk definitely gave some good pointers as well as validation for the processes <a href="http://gameplanapp.com">we've</a> already implemented.

My slides from yesterday are here:
