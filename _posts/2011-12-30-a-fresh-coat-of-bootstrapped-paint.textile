Decided to give my blog a fresh coat of <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> paint. I used Bootstrap for a small project called <a href="http://muxx.it">muxx.it</a> earlier this month and loved it &mdash; it is definitely one of the best pieces of software to come out this year (especially for design-sense-challenged folks such as myself).

The main reason I wanted to re-design my blog was that I've been meaning to pen a year-end of review of what's been quite a roller-coaster twelve months. I didn't want to publish something on what was quite frankly, an ugly and dated site, and so here we are.

Hopefully I'll get down to writing my year-end review in the next couple of days.
