Before I begin this post, let me warn you that I'm a very poor power-user of my tools. So if this post has a high-school-girl's-giddy-excitement ring to something which has been blindingly obvious to everybody, please excuse me.

I've been using "GitX":http://gitx.frim.nl/index.html to look at commits to "Wego.com":http://www.wego.com projects for a few months now and I always wished that it had a command-line option to launch it (similar to "Textmate's":http://macromates.com/ mate command). I like GitX's clean interface, search functionality and the fact that it's open source.

But today I realized that GitX *did* have a command-line tool that you can use to launch it from your Git repo. It can be enabled like so:

What this does is that it copies the executable <span class="code">gitx</span> to <span class="code">/usr/local/bin</span>.

Some of the other useful commands that I've started to use (more examples can be seen at the "user manual":http://gitx.frim.nl/user_manual.html):

<script src="http://gist.github.com/144367.js"></script>

If you think some of the options look familiar, you're right. GitX accepts command-line arguments which you normally provide to <span class="code">"git log":http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-log</span> and <span class="code">"git diff":http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-diff</span>.

Happy GitXing!
