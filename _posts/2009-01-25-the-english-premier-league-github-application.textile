After half a day's worth of data-gathering and HTML/CSS/Javascript, I present to you: the "EPL GitHub App":http://epl.github.com.

(Works on the "iPhone":http://epl.github.com/iphone too)

Brought to you by: "GitHub":http://www.github.com, "JQuery":http://www.jquery.com, "UiUIKit":http://code.google.com/p/iphone-universal, "Ruby":http://www.github.com/arunthampi/epl

With inspiration from: "Paul Buchheit":http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2009/01/communicating-with-code.html

It's still very rough around the edges, and there are some more features I'd like to add. But I've found a new interesting side project to work on.
