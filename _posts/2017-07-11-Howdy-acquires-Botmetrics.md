## Howdy acquires Botmetrics

We’re excited to announce today that [Howdy](https://www.howdy.ai) is acquiring [Botmetrics](https://www.getbotmetrics.com)!

We started Botmetrics with the aim of enabling bot makers to better understand their users and increase engagement within the brand new conversational UI paradigm. Together with Botkit, we have **_processed over half a billion customer interactions_** and customers love Botmetrics for its ease of use and simplicity.

#### Enter Howdy

We have been big fans of Howdy since they started over two years ago and they are the [**_#1 framework that developers use_**](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) to build conversational agents.

We started working with the team at Howdy on a [Botkit integration](https://github.com/botmetrics/botkit-middleware-botmetrics) a few months ago and what we learnt was that customers loved the integration and wanted a more unified experience that allowed them to both build and measure their bot in _one_ place.

With Howdy’s deep commitment to open source, it became clear to us that we should take our partnership to the next level and we’re excited to embed Botmetrics more deeply within the Botkit ecosystem — both open-source as well as [Botkit Studio](https://studio.botkit.ai).

#### What’s Next?

Botmetrics will continue to operate as it is today with more details to come in the coming months on an integration with Botkit Studio. Howdy is also taking ownership of the Botmetrics open-source repository and will be accepting patches, issues and improvements.

Head over to the [Botkit Community](http://community.botkit.ai/) where [Sandeep](https://twitter.com/_sandeep) and [I](https://twitter.com/iamclovin) along with the rest of the Botkit crew will be happy to take your questions!

*   We’d like to thank our investors: [Social Capital](http://socialcapital.com) and [Graph Ventures](http://graphventures.com), our accelerator program [Plug and Play Tech Center](http://plugandplaytechcenter.com/), our users, and all of our well-wishers for your love, support and advice over the last year and we’re excited to advance the bot ecosystem together with Howdy ❤
*   Special thanks to the team at [Block71](http://block71sf.com) for their support during the last year, for providing us with excellent office space and great facilities.
