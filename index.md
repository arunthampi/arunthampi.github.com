Hi 👋🏽 I love building delightful products and platforms for developers with an eye for usability, performance and scalability. I'm currently a senior software engineer at Apple working on [Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/).

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamclovin), [Github](https://github.com/arunthampi) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/arunthampi).

🧑🏽‍💻 I've worked as a software engineer as well as started a couple of companies. Read more [here](/work.html).

✍🏽 I've written occassionally on this [blog](/archives.html) as well as on [Medium](https://medium.com/@iamclovin). Fun fact: a post I wrote in 2012 triggered a [Congressional inquiry](https://butterfield.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ranking-members-waxman-and-butterfield-want-answers-from-apple-on-iphone)!

📢 My work has been covered by the press on [many occasions](/press.html).
